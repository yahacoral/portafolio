               <h2>WHERE I'VE BEEN</h2>
               <p> When I graduated from Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in 2018 with a degree in Publicity I was confident in pursuing my career as a publicist & marketer. After I worked in a global technology consultancy, everything shifted, as I started to relate with programmers and ux designers who told me about their jobs and the endless possibilities that the world of technology offers you. 
               </p>
               <p>At that point in my life, I decided to become a full-time freelancer to study programming. Happily, I had the support of my boyfriend who dedicated himself to teaching me and bringing me tools for my learning. I joined intensive web development programs and after my first lesson I knew that becoming a developer was what I had to do with my life.</p>

               <h2>WHAT I'M DOING</h2>
               <p>I'm a front-end developer and designer based in Lima - Perú. My specialty is full website strategy, design and development, making pixel magic in photoshop and turning it into beautiful, semantic HTML & CSS. Also, I enjoy build both small and large scale applications in JavaScript for desktop, tablet or mobile. </p>
               <p>My interests, however, extend beyond the web and I also love helping people with branding and marketing strategy. </p>
               <p>When I'm not designing, I'm probably having fun with my boyfriend, watching a movie, making a new recipe or in a karaoke session at home.</p>

               <h2>WHAT I HOPE TO DO</h2>
               <p>
                 My main purpose is to get better every day. Personally and Professionally. Every day is a chance at improvement. For instance, these days I am really into in UX design.
